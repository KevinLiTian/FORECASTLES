## Homelessness in Toronto
"Homelessness is a profound assault on dignity, social inclusion and the right to life" ~ United Nations. In Toronto, homelessness has been declared a city emergency, with over 10,000 people affected daily.

## Motivation
Our goal is to optimize shelter usage in Toronto and increase access, as many are turned away daily despite shelters not being at full capacity.

## Project Aims
1. Predict service user counts for existing shelters to optimize resource allocation.
2. Forecast demand in neighborhoods without shelters to guide new shelter construction.

## Data

- **City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal:**
  - [Daily Shelter & Overnight Service Occupancy & Capacity dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/)
  - [Central Intake calls dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/central-intake-calls/)
- **Neighbourhood Profiles**

## Map Visualization - Demo
We developed a Shiny app to visualize predictions, demonstrating user count forecasts for various shelters and neighborhoods in Toronto.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- Expansion of the model beyond Toronto.
- Integration of more stable and diverse data sets.
- Focusing on demographic-specific trends in homelessness.
- Investigating the relationship between housing prices and homelessness.

## Conclusion
Our model is a significant step towards data-driven management of shelter spaces, aiding in decision-making for budgeting and planning for future years. It's a proactive tool for addressing the growing needs of the homeless population in Toronto.
